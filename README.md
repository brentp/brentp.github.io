## Local Development

### Setup with uv

1. **Install uv** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```
   Or follow the [official installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

2. **Create and activate virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   mkdocs serve
   ```

   The site will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

5. **Optional: Enable live reloading**:
   ```bash
   mkdocs serve --livereload
   ```

### Alternative: Using pip without uv

If you prefer not to use uv:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
mkdocs serve
```
