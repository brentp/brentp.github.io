A model I have in mind is 16 weeks (~\u2153rd year) of focused work for $25K commitment. This could be an alternative to committing to a staff bioinformatician. It could be for a pilot study or a focused project or certainly a long-term collaboration. Most universities can support this via vendor contract or even simpler. This is an idea, if you have another mode of work or a project in mind, feel free to contact me.</p>"},{"location":"#recommendations","title":"Recommendations","text":"Loading recommendations..."},{"location":"#key-projects","title":"Key Projects","text":"<ul> <li> <p> mosdepth  Fast BAM/CRAM depth calculation for WGS, exome, or targeted sequencing.
